- Finished wiring the Tab 3 TypeScript logic so it can search for an item by name using the inventory service and load the matching item into the page.
- Implemented the `onUpdate` and `onDelete` functions so the app can send update and delete requests to the API using the selected item’s name and data.
- Added basic validation on the search and delete names and hooked up simple success/error messages so the user knows when an action has worked or failed.
- Checked the behaviour on Tab 3 in the browser, making sure the buttons trigger the correct functions and that the page reacts properly when an item is changed or removed.
